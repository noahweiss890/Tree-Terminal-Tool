# Tree Terminal Tool

This is my implementation of the “tree” tool, in a long mode. Meaning printing the file tree with it’s permitions, user and group, and size.

### How To Run:
1. Download the git repository and open terminal at folder location.
2. Run command: ```make stree```
3. Run the program with command: ```./stree <folder_location>```
